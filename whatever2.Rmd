# Maybe I want to show you about Taylor Swift now (WHY NOT?!)

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(taylor)

metacritic <- taylor_albums

# Not Taylor's best work, so we'll give it a 72
metacritic$metacritic_score[1] <- 72L
metacritic <- subset(metacritic, !is.na(metacritic_score))
metacritic$album_name <- factor(metacritic$album_name,
                                levels = album_levels)

ggplot(metacritic, aes(x = metacritic_score, y = album_name)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = album_name), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_albums() +
  labs(x = "Metacritic Rating", y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Also, I can talk about what you see here.
